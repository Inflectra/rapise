Each web application is unique in terms of assigning attributes to elements and this complicates the process of generating XPath locators. Some applications assign dynamic IDs to elements, some use ARIA attributes and some do not, some values of class attribute have meaning related to element position and some just used for styling . There are also cases when an app contains hidden DOM layers which stack on top of each other. So usage of same set of attributes for generating XPath is not efficient and may lead to weak locators that break after application reloading or slight modification. To cope with these problems Rapise introduces Web App Profile. It is a simple JSON file of a defined structure that instructs Rapise how to build XPath for elements in a particular application.

### [KB185](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB185.aspx) Using Global.DoLoadObjects to Use Rapise Objects from External File

One of the challenges using an automated testing tool is to organize things in a way that it is logical enough to find something quickly, structured enough to avoid duplication and simple enough to maintain and upgrade. This statement is also true for Rapise objects. A common requirement is to deal with the same objects within a flow of different test cases. For instance, if an application has “Log In” functionality then many, many tests will require logging-in and logging-out. Each test will have this object in its own object tree. However this causes trouble if a change in the application affects the recognition of the Log In object. All of the test cases will need to be updated. In such situations it is much more convenient to have the “Log In” objects placed into their own file and re-used by other tests.

### [KB186](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB186.aspx) Global.DoWaitFor vs Global.DoWaitForProperty

The most commonly used synchronization option to make Rapise wait until the application under test (AUT) is ready is the Global .DoSleep(milliseconds) function. However having just a sleep may cause an unnecessary delay because we have to consider the maximum wait interval and it may be much less on average. Rapise includes some additional synchronization options for more fine grained control of the test case flow.

### [KB187](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB187.aspx) Using CheckObjectExists(xpathOrObjId) to See if Web Object Exists on Page

### [KB184](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB184.aspx) What is the purpose of the Tester.EndTest() Function?

The Tester.EndTest() function in Rapise is describes as: Marks end of a currently executed test. Calculates test results and performs finalization of test execution. We have found that some of our customers have been confused as what the purpose of this function is.

### [KB183](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB183.aspx) Desktop Application Testing - Choosing the Right Library

Suppose we have a situation that a thick-client (desktop) application under test (AUT) is based on a technology that is too old or not completely supported by Rapise. Rapise has a number of libraries for different types of apps. Usually Rapise finds the correct libraries using its auto-detection, but sometimes an application is unusual and the auto-detection fails.

### [KB182](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB182.aspx) How to automate the testing of TinyMCE Rich Text Boxes using Rapise

When you have a rich text box in a web application, the process for recording a test and playing it back will be different to a standard HTML plain text box. When you are using the popular TinyMCE rich text box you have more options to automate it by using its special client-side JavaScript API.

### [KB177](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB177.aspx) Web testing - Dynamically Switching the Browser in the Same Test

Sometimes you have a test that you want to run on Chrome, Firefox, and IE in the same script. Normally you write a browser-agnostic test and then have SpiraTest simply call Rapise with different browser names as a parameter and then you have the same test executed multiple times. However suppose you want to have a single test that by itself can run on all the necessary browsers. This article addresses this case.

### [KB176](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB176.aspx) Measuring browser performance with Rapise

How do you get the exact time that Rapise takes to load a page? Now, the reports summary shows the overall execution time but if you have pause times between steps then these times are added to the total time of that a page took to display. Customers have asked if Rapise has some kind of function that will allow them to see only the transaction time between pages without the pause times. Does Rapise have something like that? This article provides a solution to these cases.

### [KB164](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB164.aspx) Calling Rapise DoX functions without reporting result

When you use a DoX command in Rapise to perform a specific command (e.g. DoDOMChildrenCount() to get a number of object's DOM children), in the report an extra step -- assert -- is created during test execution. Sometimes you want to be able to call a function 'quietly' without it affecting the report.

### [KB163](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB163.aspx) Accessing the Computed Style Properties of an HTML DOM Object

A common question from our users is, is there a way to get object's style properties that are in effect at a certain point in time. (for example, it could have been inherited from higher level of hierarchy, or modified via JavaScript running on the page)? This article describes how to do this.

### [KB138](https://www.inflectra.com/Support/KnowledgeBase/KB138.aspx) My Actions are Not Recorded

By design Rapise tries to record user activity on the highest possible level. This makes recorded actions more readable and universal (often several lower-level user actions are combined)Rapise uses a heuristics to distinguish meaningful activity from low level actions. In some cases this leads to a result that some user activity is not automatically recorded (for example, a mouse click before entering  text in a box). There is a broad range of available UI platforms and libraries. The variety of graphical widgets makes user interface robust and beautiful. Rapise tries to recognize as much objects as possible. However this range is growing and there are always widgets that are not being recorded.
