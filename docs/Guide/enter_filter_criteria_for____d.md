## Conditions

![enter filter criteria dialog,condition](./img/enter_filter_criteria_for____d3.png)

You may specify as many conditions as you like.  Each condition has two properties, a **Matching Criteria** on the left and a **filter value** on the right.  The **filter value** is a string, and the **matching criteria** specifies what constitutes a match.   For more details, look [HERE](report_filtering.md).

## Filter Aggregation

There are two ways you can aggregate / combine filter conditions:

- **All**:  All conditions must be true to constitute a match.
- **Any**: At least one condition must be true to constitute a match.

## Buttons
