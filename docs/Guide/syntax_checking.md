# Syntax Checking

## Purpose

An editor performs **Syntax Checking** and notifies the user of syntax errors in their program/script.

## Usage

Rapise performs **Syntax Checking** as you type into the [Source Editor](source_editor.md). Messages regarding syntax errors can be found in the [Warning View](warning_view.md).

For example, you begin writing a function:

![syntax checking](./img/syntax_checking1.png)

We have a typo here. We used `}` instead of `)`. Once the error is corrected, the warning view clears automatically:

![syntax checking 2](./img/syntax_checking2.png)
