# Image Capture

![image\_editor](./img/image_capture1.png)

## Purpose

The **Drawing Tools** image editor lets you capture a section of the current screen or application under test, add annotations to help document the Â image and then attach the final result to the [current test case](manual_test_editor.md), test step, or [manual test result](manual_playback.md).

## How to Open

You can open the Drawing Tools dialog box by clicking on the **Image icon** on the various rich text editors in Rapise. When you do that, Rapise will minimize itself and display the following screen:

![image\_editor\_select\_screen\_region](./img/image_capture2.png)

You now need to draw a rectangle on your screen that tells Rapise which part of the screen you want to capture. Once that is done, the image editor will open with that part of the screen selected. If you click ESC on the keyboard, it will just open the editor with no initial image.

## Image Editor Toolbar

The image editor provides the following tools:
