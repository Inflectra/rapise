![find and replace, find](./img/find_and_replace_dialog1.png)

## Purpose

To find and replace text in files displayed in the Rapise [Content View](content_view.md).

## How to Open

Use main menu `Edit > Find in Files` or click magnifier icon on the toolbar.

## Find in Files Tab

- **Find what**: Place the string you would like to search for in the **Find what** text box.
- **Look In:** this option specifies where the search will take place. You can limit the search to: current document, current selection, current test, the entire test and subtests, or a specific folder.
- **Directory path**: Use the Directory Path text-box to specify the directory in which to search.  The Directory path text-box cannot be accessed (and is ignored) if the **Test files** checkbox is checked.
- Check the **Include sub-folders** option to search recursively from the directory specified in the **Directory Path** text-box. The Include sub-folders option cannot be accessed if the **Test files** checkbox is checked.
- **Match case option:** If unselected, case is ignored in the search.
- **Match whole word option**:  If set to true, parts of words will not count as matches.
- **Look at these file types**: Search only files with the specified file type(s).

## Find and Replace Tab

There is only one significant difference between the **Find in Files** Tab and **Find and Replace** Tab: the **Replace with** text-box.

- **Replace with text-box**: All occurrences of the string in the **Find what** text-box will be replaced with the string in the **Replace with** text-box when you press the **Replace** button.
